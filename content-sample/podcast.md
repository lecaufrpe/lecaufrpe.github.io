About: Stop Fossil Fuels: Why We Must, How We Can

Environmental crises loom. Green technology, energy efficiency, and peak oil aren't enough to head off catastrophe. We must directly shut down the fossil flows with strategies and tactics appropriate for the number of people we have available and the time we have left.

We research and disseminate effective strategies and tactics to halt fossil fuel combustion as fast as possible.
