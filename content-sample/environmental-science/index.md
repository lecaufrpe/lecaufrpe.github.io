# Environmental Science
♻️ Path to a free self-taught education in Environmental Science!

## About

This is a self-study based heavily on the format, structure, methodology, and principles of the [OSSU curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I am not affiliated with OSSU, but I'd like to make this curriculum public and open to contribution in the spirit of their existing curricula. 

By following this curriculum, the goal is for you to complete an **Environmental Science** course in an independent and self-paced manner, for free!

Due to the wide-ranging and interdisciplinary nature of environmental science, this curriculum may not be completely comprehensive. I encourage you to contribute if you would like to help improve it.

### Capstone Project
- Any ideas? Make a pull request and suggest some!


### Specializations

The courses above are meant to be a general overview of what a typical environmental science course entails. After completing the above, you can pursue a specialized field of environmental science, such as:

* [Water Resources and Management](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-731-water-resource-systems-fall-2006/)
* [Sustainable Energy](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-081j-introduction-to-sustainable-energy-fall-2010/)
* And so much more!

Have any suggestions or would like to help create a complete list of specializations + the relevant courses? Feel free to make a pull request!

## Prerequisites

Not much besides how to use Git to contribute to the curriculum!

I'm an amateur in environmental science, having no educational or professional background in it, so this curriculum is designed so that you can start with little-to-no college-level prerequisites.


## Contribution

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and suggest how this curriculum could be improved.

You can also [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) if you'd like to add a resource or fix an issue.
